# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: [July 16, 2025]_

**Journal Questions** is a journaling app developed with a strong focus on user privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information.

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

We do **not** collect, store, or share any personal data from users. Specifically:

- No account or login is required.
- No names, emails, or identifiers are collected.
- All journal entries and user content are stored **locally on your device** and never sent to any server.
- We do not track your usage, location, or behavior in the app.

## 2. Local Storage

All data you enter into the app, including your name (if used), journal entries, or other settings, are stored only on your device. The app does not transmit this data to us or to any third party.

## 3. In-App Purchases

Journal Questions offers optional in-app purchases and subscriptions via **Google Play Billing**. These transactions are handled securely by Google. We do not have access to your payment or billing information.

## 4. Audio & Video Content

The app includes optional background **audio and video** content for a better journaling experience. These files are streamed via **Cloudflare CDN**. While streamed content may require network access and device speaker playback, **no user data is collected or transmitted** during playback.

## 5. Backups and Data Export

The app allows users to **manually back up or import** their journal data. These backups are saved **only to user-selected locations** (e.g. device storage or cloud drives). We do not access, store, or transmit this data.

## 6. No Third-Party Analytics or Tracking

We do not use any third-party analytics tools or error/crash reporting. Your app usage is entirely private and offline.

## 7. Device Permissions

The app may request minimal permissions such as:

- **Storage access** – to enable saving and importing journal backups.
- **Network access** – to stream background audio and video content.
- **Notification access** – to allow scheduling reminders or journaling prompts at user-defined times.


These permissions are strictly limited to functionality and **not used for tracking or data collection**.

## 8. Children's Privacy

Journal Questions is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone, including children.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with a revised date at the top.

## 10. Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us through the app by navigating to **Settings → Contact Us**.
